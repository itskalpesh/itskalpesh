## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **BCA student** who is genuinely interested in learning how software works under the hood.  
I focus on **understanding fundamentals first**, then applying them through small projects.

I believe in learning by doing, making mistakes, and improving consistently —  
**Code with Karma** 🌱
